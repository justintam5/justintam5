### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I just graduated from the University of Ottawa with a degree in Physics, and a degree in Electrical Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning C++, and Japanese. 
- ðŸ“š Looking for an expirenced highschool/university tutor for Math, Physics, Engineering, or Computer Science? I have 4 years of tutor experience with people of all ages and priorities. I teach with the idea that any class can be broken down into a small set of core concepts, ontop of which the rest of the knowledge and ideas can be built easily. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jt.tam514@gmail.com
