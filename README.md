### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my 6th year of a double degree in Physics/Electrical Eng. at the University of Ottawa.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning C++, and Japanese.
- âš¡ Favorite Show: Naruto
- ðŸ“š Looking for an expirenced highschool/university tutor for Math, Physics, Engineering, or Computer Science? I have 4 years of tutor experience with people of all ages and priorities. I teach with the idea that any class can be broken down into a small set of core concepts, ontop of which the rest of the knowledge and ideas can be built easily.
