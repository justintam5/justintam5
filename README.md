### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I just graduated from the University of Ottawa with a degree in Physics, and a degree in Electrical Engineering. I'm currently in a 2-year, thesis based Masters in Medical Physics at Dalhousie University.
- 🌱 I’m learning C++, and Japanese. 
- 📚 Looking for an expirenced highschool/university tutor for Math, Physics, Engineering, or Computer Science? I have 4 years of tutor experience with people of all ages and priorities. I teach with the idea that any class can be broken down into a small set of core concepts, ontop of which the rest of the knowledge and ideas can be built easily.
